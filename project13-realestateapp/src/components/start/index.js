              Great Opportunity to get into the real estate market for less than
              the cost of Rent!! It keeps coming... w/w carpet throughout the
              residence, granite island, drive in garage with workshop area &
              vaulted ceilings showcasing the log construction. This is a
              prestigious home. Note: large 6 ft basement for storage not
              included in measurements.
